\chapter{Conclusion}

More testing with different tires need to be done. Test driving have only been performed with two different sets of tires in this work which of course restricts the possibilities to create a friction coefficient estimator that works for all tires. Although, it's believed that the tire selector that has been developed can easily be extended to handle all kinds of tires but this requires a lot more test data.

The estimator could also be extended with several modules to enable better estimation of the friction coefficient. Methods to estimate $ V_{y} $ (lateral velocity) and $ \alpha $ (slip angle) could greatly improve estimations of the vehicles dynamics state. Which would further on improve the reliability of vehicle and tire models.
