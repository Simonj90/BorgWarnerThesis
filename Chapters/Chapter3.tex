\section{Tire/road friction models/methods}

There have been extensive research within this field for the last fifty years and this results in many different approaches to model tire/road friction. Some of the more relevant models/methods for this work will be presented here.

\subsection{Mue}

\begin{equation}
\mu(F_{z})=\mu_{nominal}*(\mu_{max} + (-k)\frac{F_{z} - F_{z_{0}}}{F_{z_{0}}})
\end{equation}

\subsection{Assumptions and restrictions}



\subsection{Slip-based friction model}
