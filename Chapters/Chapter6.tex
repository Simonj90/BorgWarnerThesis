\section{Future work}

test with different tires!

\section{Tire model parameters}
When the work started, we had no idea that different tires would differ so much. Very very important to know what kind of tires we have!!!!

\section{Losses}
Try to describe the losses better. Driveline losses, how good are they?

\section{Slip ratio}
Should be calculated from the difference between angular and forward velocity. Not the angular velocity of the fron and rear wheels. 


\section{Weight transfer}
Weight transfer should be effected by the curb stiffness.
