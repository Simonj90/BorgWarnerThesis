\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Future work}
More testing with different tires need to be done. Test driving have only been done with two different sets of tires in this work which of course restricts the possibilities to create a friction coefficient estimator that works for all tires. Although, it's believed that the tire selector that has been developed can easily be extended to handle all kinds of tires but this requires a lot more test data.

\section{Tire model parameters}
When the work started, we had no idea that different tires would differ so much. Very very important to know what kind of tires we have!!!!

\section{Losses}
Try to describe the losses better. Driveline losses, how good are they?

\section{Slip ratio}
Should be calculated from the difference between angular and forward velocity. Not the angular velocity of the fron and rear wheels. 


\section{Weight transfer}
Weight transfer should be effected by the curb stiffness.
